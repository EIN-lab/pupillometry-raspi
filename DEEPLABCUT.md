# Video Analysis with DeepLabCut

// Put all of this in a jupyter notebook? //

## Introduction
[DeepLabCut](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut) is a deep-learning software package designed for 3D markerless pose estimation from video files. Here, we use it to identify points on the edge of the pupil to estimate pupil diameter. We provide a pre-trained network that the user can further improve by training with their own data.

More information on DeepLabCut ont he [website](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut), the [Nature Neuroscience paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y) and the [Nature Protocols paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-019-0176-0).

## Basic instructions
Follow the instructions in the [original protocol](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-019-0176-0) to install DeepLabCut and its dependencies. Then, use this [jupyter notebook]() to either train your own network or improve the pre-trained network with your own data for a more versatile model.
